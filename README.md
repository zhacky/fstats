# fstats
Coding practice for printing file statistics

_Basically just a java console app that takes files, read and evaluate them and prints them to the console_

At the end of the process, it will move the file to the _processed_ directory

To run the app, 

   java -jar fstats.jar
   
   (or just run the code from the IDE)
